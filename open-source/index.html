	<h1>Open-source projects I've created</h1>
	<p>I enjoy open-sourcing libraries I've created during a project for a client or myself.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://github.com/LasseRafn/php-initial-avatar-generator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PHP Initial Avatar Generator</a></h2>
	<p>I found that my clients and my employeers clients rarely use services like gravatar, so I wanted to find another way to make avatars a tad more personal by default; and quickly realised that everone else does this; uses the initials of the logged in user to create a avatar.</p>
	<p>This made me spend a few hours on my weekend, to create a simple package that allows you to generate such avatars super easy.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://github.com/LasseRafn/laravel-dinero" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Laravel Dinero API wrapper</a></h2>
	<p>I work a lot with API's from invoicing systems and similar, hence why it made sense to make a API wrapper for the simple invoicing system "Dinero".</p>

	<h2><a href="https://github.com/LasseRafn/laravel-economic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Laravel E-conomic API wrapper</a></h2>
	<p>Same reason above; LOTS of invoicing and bookeeping integrations. "E-conomic" is also a similar system, and this is a wrapper for their REST API.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://github.com/LasseRafn/laravel-intempus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Laravel Intempus API wrapper</a></h2>
	<p>Some of our clients use the timetracking software "Intempus" and I decided to pack the API wrapper I made for some integrations, into a library for Laravel.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://github.com/LasseRafn/laravel-pipedrive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Laravel Pipedrive API wrapper</a></h2>
	<p>My current employeer uses Pipedrive for their sales (and so does some of our clients), so to automate some processes; I made some integrations and this is the API wrapper I made to do so.</p>
